  The results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of adults,
  age 18 +, living in the U.S. In 2017 the interviews were conducted with a
  minimum quota of 70% cell phone respondents and 30% landline respondents.
  Phone numbers are selected using random digit dial methods. Landline
  respondents are chosen at random within each household based on the adult with
  the next birthday. Samples are weighted to correct for unequal probability of
  selection, non-response, and double coverage of landline and cell users in the
  two sampling frames. They are also weighted to match known national
  demographics of gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, region,
  population density and phone status. All estimates are subject to sampling
  error. Each year, the margin of error is approximately +/- 4 percentage points
  at the 95% confidence level. (For additional detail, see
