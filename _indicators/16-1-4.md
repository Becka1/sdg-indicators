  As indicated by the Gallup News Service, October 2014: Results are based on
  telephone interviews conducted in October, with a random sample of adults, age
  18+, living in the U.S.. (In 2014, 1017 adults were interviewed.) Results have
  a margin of sampling error of +/- 4 percentage points at the 95% confidence
  level.

  Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones and cell
  phones.  Each sample includes a minimum quota of 50% cell phone respondents
  and 50% landline respondents, with additional quots ny region.  Telephone
  numbers are selected using random digit dial methods.  Landline respondents
  are chosen at random within each household on the basis of which member had
  the most recent birthday.

  Samples are weighted to correct for unequal selection probability,
  non-response, and double coverage of landline and cell used in two sampling
  frames.

  The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), conducted by the U.S. Census
  Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics does not collect this information;
  however, as part of methodological work for the NCVS redesign, BJS is
  conducting the American Crime Survey. This survey includes an item similar to
  the Gallup survey: Is there any place within a mile of your home where you
  would be afraid to walk alone at night? [ ] Yes  [ ] No.   The survey is being
  pilot tested as a mail survey, self-administered by persons in the household.
  The test includes a split sample of about 200,000 households/persons. See the
  OMB clearance on this for additional details:
  https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201502-1121-001.

  The pilot test is near completion; with resutls expected by fall of 2017. The
  pilot test results will be used to determine whether the item is added to the
  redesigned NCVS and the mode of collection (self-administered mail survey,
  telephone survey or face-to-face person interview).
